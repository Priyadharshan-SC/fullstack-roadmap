               Hi! I'm a passionate and curious Computer Science student at KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology, with a strong focus on full-stack web development and an ever-growing interest in Generative AI, freelancing, and content creation. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.

Currently, I'm building my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, MongoDB, and more, following a structured 6-month roadmap toward becoming a full-stack developer. I also have hands-on experience with tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Jupyter Lab, and Blender.

Apart from coding, I love exploring how creativity and technology intersectâ€”whether itâ€™s through designing interfaces, editing videos, or creating content. I believe in continuous learning, building meaningful projects, and contributing to the tech community.

<ul>ðŸ“Œ Current Goals:</ul>

<li>Build and deploy full-stack projects.</li>
<li>Learn and apply machine learning techniques.</li>
<li>Contribute to open-source projects.
</li>
<li>Grow my freelancing portfolio and network.
</li>
 Letâ€™s connect and build something great together

            <p>Certifications</p>
            <p>
                I strongly believe in continuous learning and upskilling. As part of my journey in technology and development, Iâ€™ve completed several industry-recognized courses and certifications that reflect my commitment to mastering new skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in computer science, web development, and emerging technologies.

Each certification listed here represents hands-on experience, applied knowledge, and a step forward in my professional development. From foundational programming to specialized topics like full-stack development, data science, and AI, these achievements demonstrate both my dedication and curiosity.

Feel free to explore the certifications belowâ€”each one is backed by respected platforms such as Coursera, edX, freeCodeCamp, LinkedIn Learning, and more.
